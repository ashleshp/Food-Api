# Food-Api
This is Sample Api that I have made using javascript and is deployed on Heroku service

It has 3 methods 
1) url/menu 'GET' : To fetch contents of JSON
2) url/menu 'POST' : To temporarily add JSON contents

It returns a list of javascript objects which consists of name,description and image of the dish
